I'm Maija Kekkonen, a software engineer and a web and mobile developer from Finland. I have experience in developing both single page and traditional web apps and browser-based/hybrid mobile applications.

I have done full stack web development with several different technologies. In frontend the technologies have included mainly React. My backend experience includes Java, ASP.NET and Django. I have also developed mobile apps with e.g. Cordova. I have participated in testing applications, and I routinely write unit tests for my code. I have done some UI test automation as well.

In my free time I enjoy developing side projects and deepening my technical skills. My hobbies include bicycling, reading, and retro games. I'm interested in mathematics, physics, electronics, biology, and psychology.
