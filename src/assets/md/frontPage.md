I'm Maija Kekkonen, a software engineer and a web/mobile developer from Finland. I have experience in developing single page web apps and browser-based/hybrid mobile applications.

React is the technology I'm most familiar with. I have experience is backend development too, technologies being ASP.NET and Django.

Before choosing information technology as my career I studied agriculture and equine (horse) industry. This brings multi-disciplinary knowledge to my skill set.

In my free time I enjoy developing games and deepening my technical skills. My hobbies include bicycling, reading and retro games. I'm interested in mathematics, physics, electronics and psychology.
