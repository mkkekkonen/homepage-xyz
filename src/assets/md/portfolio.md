I showcase my most important personal projects here.

### Math Visualized

This is a web app I wrote to teach myself math and physics. The technologies used are TypeScript, React, the Konva graphics library, Node.js, and Express, plus Webpack for building the frontend code.

### Nature Observations App

This mobile app is built with Ionic Framework and TypeScript. [It's currently available for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mkkekkonen.natureobservations).

The app was originally intended to be a digital herbarium, but all lists of plant species are protected by copyright. I thus built a simple app for recording generic nature observations.

This is a simple demo of generating a 3D dungeon from a map definition stored in a text file. The technologies used were Unity and C#.

### OpenGL: A Rolling Ball

This is a school project made during a course called Game Engine Architectures. Although OpenGL is more a graphics than a game engine, I chose to do a demo with it. The language used was (Visual) C++. I also used the Win32 API for window management.

### A Very Small Ninja Game

Another school project. The goal was just that: to make a simple platformer with enemies and collectibles.
